<p>Walmart uses art and science to better understand and classify their customers - "art" referring to their extensive expertise in the retail sector and "science" referring to the utilization of one of the  world's largest retail and customer databases. Customer classification can help Walmart better serve their customers in many ways, such as helping them improve store layout, better target promotions through new e-commerce platforms like apps, and analyze buying trends. </p>
